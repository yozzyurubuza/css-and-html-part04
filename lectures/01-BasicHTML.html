<!-- HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language
     - Used to describe the content of a web page. -->
<html>
  <!-- Inside the HTML element, there is always a head and a body -->
  <head>
    <!-- Elements written in here are like the settings of the page -->
    <title>Learning HTML & CSS</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Contents here are going to be visible in the page -->
    <!-- h1 for heading -->
    <h1>Javascript is fun, but so is HTML & CSS!</h1>
    <!-- p is for paragraph -->
    <p>
      You can learn JavaScript without HTML and CSS, but for DOM manipulation,
      it's useful to have some basic ideas of HTML & CSS
    </p>
    <!-- Headings have different sizes, ranging from h1 to h6 -->
    <h2>Another Heading</h2>
    <p>Just another paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
