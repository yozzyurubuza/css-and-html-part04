    <h1>Javascript is fun, but so is HTML & CSS!</h1>
    <!-- There are two attributes that can be used in any element, which is ID and Class. -->
    <!-- It is used to identify them and also manipulate via CSS -->
    <p class="first">
      You can learn JavaScript without HTML and CSS, but for DOM manipulation,
      it's useful to have some basic ideas of HTML & CSS

      <!-- Attributes are used to describe elements -->
      <!-- It described the anchor (a) element by telling on which URL it should go upon clicking -->
      <!-- This is a sample of inline element because it connects to the previous text -->
      You can learn more about it

    </p>
    <!-- h2 is a block element because it is not inline with the previous text -->
    <h2>Another Heading</h2>
    <p class="second">Just another paragraph.</p>

    <!-- Each element has corresponding attributes that will only work for them, for example, src only works in img tag. -->
    <!-- IDs have to be unique, while Class can be used over and over again -->

    />

    <!-- Div is the most generic box to put the elements inside a box -->
    <!-- In CSS, use dash to separate two different words in IDs and Classes -->
    <!-- Use the appropriate element according to the content that's in it (form vs div) is the idea of semantic HTML -->
    <form id="your-name">
      <h2>Your name here</h2>
      <p>Please fill in this form :)</p>

      <input type="text" placeholder="Your name" />
      <button>OK!</button>
    </form>
